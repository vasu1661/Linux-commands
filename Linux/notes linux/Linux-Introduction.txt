Linux:

It is also a multi-user & multi-tasking Operating system.

	user----->shell------> kernel-----> H/W

user interaction in Gui:

	User-------->KDE/Gnome------> shell------>kernel------->H/W


KERNEL:
	It is an initial process while booting system. It acts as parent for all remaining processes. It coordinates all processes with in the system.

/lib:	It contains library files

/dev:	It contains device files.

/sbin:	It contains system related .exe files
