Redirection Operators:

These are used to redirect the output or input from or to a command.

4 types

1) Input redirection : It will change the meaning of file data as console data.

ex:    command < filename


2) Output redirection : It is used to redirect the output of a command into a file.

ex:    command > filename


3) Output redirection with appending : output will be appended to existing file

ex:    command >> filename	


4) | ( pipe ) : It is used to redirect the output of a command to other command and so on.

ex:	cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3 ......



Handling Columns and Fields :

cut        -  splitting files vertically (Extract required column from a file)

paste      -  merge lines of files 

split      -  split a file into pieces

sort       -  sort lines of text files

tee        -  read from standard input and write to standard output and files

file       —  determine file type




FILE PERMISSIONS, USER TYPES:


PERMISSIONS:

read:-	If a file has read permission then only we can open or read file data

write:-	If a file has write permission then only change file data

execute:- IF a file has execute permission then only we can execute the file.



USER TYPES:

owner
group
others


Ex: Display file names along with file permissions

	ls -l 	
	
chmod ( change mode ):
	It is used to change the file permissions. File permissions can be changed by using 2 methods.

1) Symbollic mode

2) Absolute mode ( real time )


SYMBOLLIC MODE:

file permissions:

read		r
write		w
execute		x


user types:

owner		u			
group		g			
other		o
all users	a

Here we are having 2 operating symbols

+	For adding a permission

-	For removing permission

syn:	chmod   user_type [+ / -]  permissions        filename


Note:
	Default permissions of normal file
	
	rw-rw-r--

Ex:	Add execute permission for the owner on the file scpt1

	chmod  u+x  scpt1


Ex:	Add write permission to all users  on the file emp.db

	chmod u+w,g+w,o+w    emp.db
		OR
	chmod ugo+w    emp.db
		OR
	chmod a+w    emp.db


Ex:	Remove read permission from others and group users & add all permissions to the owner on the file f1

	chmod u+rwx,go-r   f1


ABSOLUTE MODE:
	In this method we can use a 3- digit code to represent file permissions and users.
	This code range is 000 to 777.
	The decimal number represents user types
	Internally each decimal number converted into a 3-digit binary number. This binary number represents permission 	list.


syn:	chmod   3-digitcode    filename


Ex:	chmod    526		emp.db


			5		2		6  [ user types ]
		      owner		group		others
			|		|		|
			|		|		|
		-------------    ---------------    -----------------
		|    |      |     |       |     |   |       |       |
Binary		1    0      1     0       1     0   1       1       0 
equivalant 	r    w      x     r       w     x   r       w       x

		r    -      x     -       w     -   r       w        -	


	The above command changing the permissions as following
	Owner having read and execute permissions
	group having only write permissions
	others having read and write permissions.


	0--no
	1--execute
	2--write
	3--write and execute
	4--read
	5--read and execute
	6--read and write
	7--read , write and execute.
